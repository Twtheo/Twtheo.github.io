				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I graduated from Colorado State University in the Spring
				of 2017 with a Bachelors Of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I was born in 
				Toronto, Canada and moved to the United States when I was only a few months old. My love of computers
				stems from my father and I spending hours building computers for our household.</p>
				<p>Currently I am working as an Associate Software Development Engineer at Charles Schwab developing
				in-house applications. Through my years at CSU and a few internships I have also developed
				a fondness for web development. I like to increase my knowledge of web development in my spare time
				in hopes of creating a successful hobby from it one day.

				<h1>Hobbies</h1>
				<p>My hobbies include Soccer, Ultimate, Mountain Biking, Skiing, Video Games, and lots of other outdoor
				activies. I love to spend time with my friends and family and our two dogs. I played soccer for as long
				as I can remember and played it all the way through highschool. I got into skiing when I was young as well
				but really started to appreciate it when I moved to Colorado. Once into college I also started to pick up 
				mountain biking and am currently still trying to get better at it and plan on making it a serious hobby.
				While in college I also started to play ultimate (credit to Mark Stratford for forcing me to go to tryouts).
				We were not very good our first year and did not even make it to regionals, we steadily got better and by my
				senior year we were making our Nationals Debut. Throughout most of my life I have played all sorts of video games
				in my free time and currently play on my home built PC.</p>
