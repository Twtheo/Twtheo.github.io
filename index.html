					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>My name is Thomas Theodorescu and I am currently working as an Associate Software Development Engineer
					at Charles Schwab. I graduated from Colorado State University in the Spring
					of 2017 with a Bachelors Of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I was born in 
					Toronto, Canada and moved to the United States when I was only a few months old. My love of computers
					stems from my father and I spending hours building computers for our household.</p>

					<h1>Hobbies</h1>
					<p>My hobbies include Soccer, Ultimamte, Mountain Biking, Skiing, Video Games, and lots of other outdoor
					activies. I love to spend time with my friends and family and our two dogs. I played soccer for as long
					as I can remember and played it all the way through highschool. I got into skiing when I was young as well
					but really started to appreciate it when I moved to Colorado. Once into college I also started to pick up 
					mountain biking and am currently still trying to get better at it and plan on making it a serious hobby.
					While in college I also started to play ultimate (credit to Mark Stratford for forcing me to go to tryouts).
					We were not very good our first year and did not even make it to regionals, we steadily got better and by my
					senior year we were making our Nationals Debut. Throughout most of my life I have played all sorts of video games
					in my free time and currently play on my home built PC.</p>
